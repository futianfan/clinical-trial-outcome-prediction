             metal prosthesis or plate) that could either interfere with the acquisition of the MRI
             scan of the brain or for whom the MRI scan would pose a potential risk will be
             excluded.

          -  Radiation exposure: Participation in any other research study involving exposure to
             ionizing radiation in the past year if the total cumulative exposure from the past
             research studies and the current research study would exceed the limits described by
             the FDA in 21 CFR 361.1. Specifically, the total cumulative dose to the whole body,
             active blood-forming organs, lens of the eye, and gonads must remain below 5 rems, and
             the cumulated dose to all other organs must remain below 15 rems over the last year.

                  such as HMG CoA inhibitors (statins), clofibrate and gemfibrozil, and that cannot
                  be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to starting LDE225 treatment. If it is
                  essential that the patient stays on a statin to control hyperlipidemia, only
                  pravastatin may be used with extra caution.

               -  Patients who are planning on embarking on a new strenuous exercise regimen after

          -  Patients who are receiving treatment with medications known to be strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have a narrow
             therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment with
             LDE225. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at
             least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting
             treatment with LDE225. Note that patients who require antifungal prophylaxis are
             preferred to be on fluconazole, and, patients taking voriconazole or posaconazole who
             must continue are excluded from the dose escalation phase of the study. Once the MTD
             is established, patients taking voriconazole or posaconazole will be allowed to enroll
             but at a dose adjustment to be determined before the expansion phase opens.

                  history of prolonged QT-interval syndrome

               -  Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g. congestive heart failure,
                  uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension, or history of poor
                  adherence with an antihypertensive regimen)

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test (> 5 mIU/mL).

          -  Patients who are not willing to apply highly effective contraception during the study
             and through the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment.

               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
                  becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and
                  through 6 months after the final dose of study treatment. Highly effective
                  contraception is defined as either:

               -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Sterilization: Patient has had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study patients, the
                  vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient]

               -  Use a combination of the following (both a+b):

                    -  Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or non-hormonal
                       intrauterine system (IUS)

                    -  Barrier method of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository.

                    -  Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, implanted) are
                       not allowed to count as contraception as it cannot be ruled out that the
                       study drug decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraception. Patients
                       are able to continue taking oral contraceptives if desired.

                    -  Note: Woman are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing
                       potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea
                       with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of
                       vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH
                       levels > 40 mIU/mL and estradiol < 20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral
                       oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the
                       case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman
                       has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered
                       not of child bearing potential

               -  Male patient must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of contraception
                  (e.g., spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the study, and
                  continue using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for 6 months
                  following the study drug. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized
                  men as well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent
                  delivery of the study treatment via seminal fluid

               -  Sexually active males who are unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while
                  taking the study drug and for 6 months after stopping investigational medications
                  and agree not to father a child in this period.

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

             men must agree to use adequate contraception: hormone, barrier method of birth
             control, or abstinence prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effect of ficlatuzumab on the
             developing fetus remains unknown and that cytarabine is a pregnancy risk category D
             drug with known teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because of the potential adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ficlatuzumab and
             cytarabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued while on study. Patients who become
             pregnant while on study will be removed from the study once the pregnancy is
             confirmed.

        A5327 Eligibility Criteria (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)

        Step 1 inclusion criteria for both cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 p24 antigen, or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral
             load. [NOTE: The term ""licensed"" refers to a FDA-approved kit, which is required for
             all IND studies.] WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control
             and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must
             use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive
             initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an
             E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle
             (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral
             load.

          -  A documented confirmation of acute HCV infection within 6 months prior to A5327 entry
             or HCV reinfection as described below:

               1. Acute HCV infection was defined as meeting one of the following criteria and
                  exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis:

                    -  New (<24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X upper
                       limit of normal (ULN) OR >250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in
                       the preceding 12 months or ≥10X ULN OR >500 U/L in patients with abnormal or
                       no measured ALT baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA
                       excluding those with any prior positive anti-HCV. OR

                    -  Detectable HCV RNA with prior negative anti-HCV Ab or undetectable HCV RNA
                       within the preceding 6 months.

               2. Acute HCV reinfection was defined by documentation of clearance of prior
                  infection (as evidenced by positive anti-HCV Ab) either spontaneously or after
                  treatment with two negative HCV RNA a minimum of 6 months apart AND meeting one
                  of the following criteria in addition to exclusion of other causes of acute
                  hepatitis:

                    -  New (<24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X ULN OR
                       >250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in the preceding 12 months
                       or ≥10X ULN OR >500 U/L in patients with abnormal or no measured ALT
                       baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA. OR

                    -  Positive HCV RNA with prior negative HCV RNA within the preceding 6 months.

          -  HCV RNA confirmed to be detectable >12 weeks after first laboratory evidence of acute
             HCV and still within the <24 week from first laboratory evidence of acute HCV
             infection window. First laboratory evidence of infection was defined as date of first
             elevated liver enzymes or date of first serologic evidence of HCV seroconversion
             and/or viremia (whichever occurs first). [NOTE: If the screening visit occurred less
             than 12 weeks from the first laboratory evidence of infection, then the participant
             was required a pre-entry study visit to confirm detectable HCV RNA at least 12 weeks
             from the first laboratory evidence of infection had passed. It was optimal for this
             pre-entry visit to occur as close as possible to 12 weeks from first laboratory
             evidence to ensure timely treatment. Potential participants who entered screening but
             who had an undetectable HCV RNA (<LLOQ TND) at the pre-entry visit (when required)
             exhibited evidence of possible spontaneous clearance and will not meet the entry
             criteria.]

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 kg/m^2

          -  Screening electrocardiogram (ECG) without clinically significant abnormalities as
             determined by the investigator.

          -  Men and women age ≥ 18 years.

          -  All participants agreed not to participate in a conception process (eg, active attempt
             to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization). [NOTE:
             Female candidates who were pregnant or breastfeeding were not eligible. A male
             candidate who had a pregnant female partner was not eligible for the study.]

          -  When participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, all participants
             must agree to use at least two reliable forms of contraceptive simultaneously while
             receiving protocol-specified medications, and for 6 months after stopping the
             medications. Such methods included:

               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent

               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

               -  Tubal ligation

               -  Hormone-based contraceptive (except those containing drospirenone)

        [NOTE: Providers and participants were advised that not all contraceptive choices listed
        above can prevent HIV transmission and that some may actually increase the risk of HIV
        acquisition. Study participants who were sexually active with HIV-1 negative or unknown
        HIV-1 serostatus partners were advised that they needed to consider effective strategies
        for reducing the risk of HIV transmission, as well as meeting the requirement for effective
        contraception during their participation in the study. Study participants discussed
        contraceptive choices and HIV risk reduction methods with their health care provider.]

          -  Participants who were not of reproductive potential (women who had been
             post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or had undergone hysterectomy
             and/or bilateral oophorectomy or salpingectomy or men who had documented azoospermia
             or undergone vasectomy) were eligible without requiring the use of contraceptives.
             Acceptable documentation of sterilization and menopause was specified below.

               -  Written or oral documentation communicated by clinician or clinician's staff of
                  one of the following:

               -  Physician report/letter

               -  Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record (a

             is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation +/- chemo if that
             was used as initial therapy) or a subsequent therapy; the intent therefore is that GBM

               1. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman had
                  been confirmed by follow- up hormone level assessment

               3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of

                       intrauterine system (IUS)

                    2. Barrier method of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository.

                       Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, implanted) are
                       not allowed as it cannot be ruled out that the study drug decreases the
                       effectiveness of hormonal contraception.

                       Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not child bearing potential
                       if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an
                       appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor
                       symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels >40
                       mIU/mL and estradiol <20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
                       (with or without hysterectomy) at least six week ago. In the case of
                       oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
                       confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of
                       child bearing potential.

             with sonidegib. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued
             at least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting
             treatment with sonidegib

             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential.]

         22. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the
             drug and for 30 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this
             period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent

             clinical signs of CNS disease and no evidence of CNS leukemia on the most recent 2
             simultaneous CSF evaluations. (2) Use of one dose of cytarabine (up to 2 g/m2) or
             hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the
             start of study therapy and for the first four weeks on therapy. These medications will
             be recorded in the case-report form.

             study until 3 months after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception
             include: Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
             of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository

         14. (Continued from Criteria 13) In case of use of oral contraception, women should have
             been stable on the same pill before taking study treatment. Note: Oral contraceptives
             are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier method of contraception
             due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction. Women are considered post-menopausal
             and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous)
             amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of
             vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without

             false-positive is suspected. For example, when beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is
             high and partner is vasectomized, it may be associated with tumour production of hCG,
             as seen with some cancers. Patient will be considered eligible if an ultrasound is
             negative for pregnancy.

         17. Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a
             nonsterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of
             contraception from the time of screening, and must have agreed to continue using such
             precautions for 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or for 6 months after the
             last dose of tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Non-sterilized male partners of a
             female subject must have used male condoms plus spermicide throughout this period.
             Cessation of birth control after this point should have been discussed with a
             responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the
             trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice; however, periodic
             abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not acceptable methods
             of birth control.

             Female subjects should have refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period
             described above.

             Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically
             sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete
             hysterectomy) or postmenopausal.

             Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:

               -  Females < 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Females ≥ 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent
                  surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or
                  hysterectomy).

             Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum β-HCG pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) conducted during screening
             and a negative urine β-HCG pregnancy test conducted prior to study drug administration
             on Day -31. Ongoing serum pregnancy tests were conducted according to the study
             protocol.

             Nonsterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening
             through 90 days after last dose of durvalumab or through 6 months after the last dose
             of tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Female partners (of childbearing potential) of
             a male subject must have used a highly effective method of contraception throughout
             the period described above. Cessation of birth control after this point should have
             been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the
             total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice;
             however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not
             acceptable methods of contraception.

             Male subjects should have refrained from sperm donation throughout this period. A
             highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low
             failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note
             that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g., male or
             female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or
             without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral
             hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of
             action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and
             triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

         18. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to
             prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have
             put the subject at unacceptable risk.

         19. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following
             the last durvalumab treatment or for 6 months following the last tremelimumab
             treatment, whichever was longer.

        Microbicide Studies Addendum 1 to the DAIDS Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric AEs,
        Version 1.0, December 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009).

        Note: Women 21 years of age or older with a documented normal result within the 12 months
        prior to enrollment need not have Pap smear during the screening period. Women with a Grade
        1 abnormal Pap smear can be enrolled upon completion of the initial phase of evaluation if
        no current treatment is indicated (based on local standard of care for management of
        abnormal cervical cytology). Need for a repeat Pap within 6 months does not preclude
        enrollment prior to that result becoming available.

          -  At Screening, has severe pelvic relaxation such that either the vaginal walls or the
             uterine cervix descend beyond the vaginal introitus with Valsalva maneuver.

          -  Has any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would preclude informed
             consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate interpretation of study outcome
             data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives.

          8. No CVA within 6 months, no MI within 6 months

          9. The effects of mFOLFIRINOX on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because chemotherapy agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial
             are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

         10. Negative pregnancy test in females of reproductive age

         11. Anticoagulation is permitted but patients may not be on warfarin.

         12. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy for pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma prior to entering the study.

          2. Pathologic subtypes other than pure adenocarcinoma; acinar cell carcinoma, squamous
             cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine cancer, and mixed types are not
             eligible.

          3. Patients who are receiving any investigational agents.

          4. Patients with borderline resectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease.

             chronic diarrhea or inflammatory disease of the colon or rectum, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. mFOLFIRINOX is a regimen containing more
             than one chemotherapy agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with mFOLFIRINOX, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents. These potential risks may
             also apply to other agents used in this study.

          8. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with mFOLFIRINOX. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          9. Currently active second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma
             in-situ of the cervix. Patients are not considered to have a ""currently active""

             the projected course of the study).

          7. Women of child bearing potential who were pregnant as evidenced by positive serum
             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic
             gonadotropin) or nursing.

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a
             non-sterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of
             contraception (see table below) from the time of screening and must have agreed to
             continue using such precautions for 90 days after the final dose of investigational
             products. Non-sterilized male partners of a female subject must have used male condoms
             plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point
             should have been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual
             activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an
             acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
             withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control.

             Female subjects should have refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period
             described above.

             Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically
             sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete
             hysterectomy) or post-menopausal.

             Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:

               -  Females <50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Females ≥50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year prior to
                  study entry, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year prior to
                  study entry, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy,
                  bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).

             Non-sterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening
             through 90 days after receipt of the final dose of investigational products. Male
             subjects were to refrain from sperm donation throughout this period. Female partners
             (of childbearing potential) of a male subject must have used a highly effective method
             of contraception (see table below) throughout this period. Cessation of birth control
             after this point was to be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in
             sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an
             acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
             withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control.

             A highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note
             that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g. male or
             female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or
             without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral
             hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation was not the primary mode of
             action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and
             triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

          9. Subjects who were immunosuppressed, including those with known immunodeficiency.

         10. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that included clinical
             history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis testing in
             line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive 1/2
             antibodies). Subjects with a past or resolved hepatitis B virus infection (defined as
             the presence of hepatitis B core antibody and absence of hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen) were eligible. Subjects positive for hepatitis C antibody were eligible only
             if polymerase chain reaction was negative for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid.

         11. History of severe allergic reactions to any unknown allergens or components of the
             study drugs.

         12. Other serious illnesses (e.g., serious infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding
             disorders).

         13. Mental impairment that may have compromised compliance with the requirements of the
             study.

         14. Lack of availability for immunological and clinical follow-up assessment.

         15. Inability to swallow or retain oral medication, presence of active gastrointestinal
             disease or other condition that would have interfered significantly with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of ensartinib.

         16. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to
             prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have
             put the subject at unacceptable risk.

         17. History of allogeneic organ transplant.

         18. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following
             the last durvalumab treatment.

          -  The effects of nivolumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. WOCBP should use an adequate method
             to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks) after the last dose of investigational drug
             Nivolumab. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24
             hours prior to the start of nivolumab. Women must not be breastfeeding. Men who are
             sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of
             less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP
             will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last
             dose of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e.,
             who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not
             require contraception. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any
             female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization
             (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is
             defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of
             other biological or physiological causes. WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed
             to adhere to contraception for a period of 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required
             for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational
             product. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be
             instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of
             investigational product. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of
             the half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that
             WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually active
             with WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this
             study, she (or the participating partner) should inform the treating physician
             immediately. 18

             earlier.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known CNS involvement may be excluded because of poor prognosis and
             concerns regarding progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. However, if CNS disease is cleared
             before the treatment with Nivolumab, patients could be allowed if no permanent CNS
             damage.

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.

             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Nivolumab is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with Nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with Nivolumab.

          -  Patients with known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) might be enrolled if the viral load

               -  A total bilirubin level lass than equals to (<=) 1.5 × upper limit of normal
                  (ULN) range

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels <= 2.5 × ULN (≤ 3 × ULN for expansion
                  cohorts)

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels <= 2.5 × ULN (≤ 3 × ULN for expansion
                  cohorts)

             purposes of this trial, women of childbearing potential are defined as all female
             subjects after puberty unless they are postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically
             sterile or sexually inactive.

          -  Highly effective contraception (ie, methods with a failure rate of less than 1% per
             year) must be used before start of treatment, for duration of trial treatment, and for
             at least 50 days after stopping study treatment for both men and women if risk of
             conception exists. The effects of avelumab and M9241 on developing human fetus are
             unknown; thus, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use highly
             effective contraception.

        Part B:

          -  Availability of a fresh tumor biopsy is mandatory for eligibility in the RCC cohort.
             The biopsy or surgical specimen should be collected within 28 days prior to the first
             IMP administration. If a subject has 2 separate biopsy attempts in which usable tissue
             is not obtained, enrollment may be possible after discussion with the Medical Monitor.
             For other expansion cohorts, availability of either tumor archival material (< 6
             months old) or fresh biopsies (obtained within 28 days) is acceptable with one of
             these being mandatory. For formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, either block or

             transitional cell carcinoma of urothelium(including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary
             bladder, and urethra). Subjects must have progressed during or after treatment with at
             least 1 platinum-containing regimen for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic UC
             or disease recurrence. Subjects who received prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy
             and progressed within 12 months of treatment with a platinum-containing regimen will
             be considered as second line. Subjects with mixed histologies are required to have a
             dominant transitional cell pattern.

          -  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), first-line metastatic: Stage IV (per seventh
             International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer classification) histologically
             confirmed NSCLC. Subjects must not have received treatment for their metastatic
             disease. Subjects could have received adjuvant chemotherapy or loco-regional treatment
             that included chemotherapy for locally advanced disease, as long as disease recurrence
             occurred at least 6 months after the completion of the last administration of
             chemotherapy. Only epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma
             kinase (ALK) wild-type are allowed (ie, EGFR mutation and ALK translocation / re
             arrangement excluded). Non squamous cell histologies and never / former light smoker
             (< 15 pack years) squamous cell carcinoma subjects (per local standard of care)
             require testing if status is unknown. Subjects must have low tumor PD-L1 expression
             defined as < 50% tumor proportion score determined using PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx test
             or an equivalent Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved PD-L1 test. Availability
             of either tumor archival material or fresh biopsies within 28 days is acceptable with
             one of these being mandatory. For FFPE samples, either block or sections (> 15) may be
             provided. Tumor biopsies and tumor archival material must be suitable for biomarker
             assessment. This cohort will not be opened for enrollment in Belgium, Czech Republic,
             France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom.

          -  Colorectal cancer (CRC): Histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent or

             edition) after failure of prior therapy containing oxaliplatin / fluoropyrimidine and
             / or irinotecan / fluoropyrimidine and, if eligible, cetuximab (Erbitux®) and
             bevacizumab (Avastin®). Only subjects with microsatellite instability (MSI)-low or
             microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC are eligible. Subjects without existing MSI
             test results will have MSI status performed locally by a Clinical Laboratory
             Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified IHC or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
             test (PCR based MSI test is preferred). Subjects must be willing to undergo an
             on-treatment biopsy procedure. Availability of either tumor archival material or fresh
             biopsies within 28 days is acceptable with one of these being mandatory. For FFPE
             samples, either block or sections (> 15) may be provided. Tumor biopsies and tumor
             archival material must be suitable for biomarker assessment. For Belgium, Czech
             Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom,
             subjects in the second-line setting should have exhausted or be considered ineligible
             or intolerant (in the opinion of the Investigator) of available second-line
             chemotherapy options.

          -  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), primary immune checkpoint inhibitor failure:
             Histologically or cytologically documented metastatic RCC with a component of clear
             cell subtype. Subjects must have had progressive disease (PD) within 6 months or best
             overall response of stable disease (SD) for ≥ 6 months following start of therapy with
             any antibody / drug targeting T cell co-regulatory proteins (immune checkpoints) such
             as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anticytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) for
             advanced or metastatic disease (either as monotherapy or combination therapy, in any
             line). Fresh tumor biopsy is required for enrollment. If a subject has 2 separate
             biopsy attempts in which usable tissue is not obtained, enrollment may be possible
             after discussion with Medical Monitor. Subjects must be willing to undergo an
             on-treatment biopsy procedure. In France, in addition to having received checkpoint
             inhibitor therapy, subjects should have already received recommended local-standard
             therapy per discretion of the Investigator.

             or equal to 2.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the
             following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication
             until 2 weeks after the last dose of study medication: a) Vasectomy with documentation
             of azoospermia. The documentation on male sterility can come from the site
             personnel's: review of subject's medical records, medical examination and/or semen
             analysis, or medical history interview. B) Male condom. The allowed method of
             contraception is only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance
             with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects
             understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.

          -  Female of non-reproductive potential (FNRP) is eligible to participate in this study
             if she meets at least one of the following conditions: a) Females with one of the
             following procedures documented and no plans to utilize assisted reproductive
             techniques (e.g., in vitro fertilization or donor embryo transfer): bilateral tubal
             ligation or salpingectomy, hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up
             confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral Oophorectomy
             (surgical menopause); b) Post-menopausal women including Females 60 years of age or
             older, A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an
             appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate, more than 45 years, in the
             absence of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or medical suppression of the menstrual
             cycle (e.g., leuprolide treatment). In questionable cases for women less than 60 years
             of age, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol
             falling into the central laboratory's post-menopausal reference range is confirmatory
             (these levels need to be adjusted for specific laboratories/assays. Females fewer than
             60 years of age, who are on HRT and wish to continue, and whose menopausal status is
             in doubt, should not be enrolled in this study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT
             to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most
             forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and
             the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following
             confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can enroll into the study and
             resume use of HRT.

             outside the threshold value, triplicate ECGs may be performed with the QTcB values
             averaged.

          -  Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would put the subject at
             un-acceptable risk for the participation in the trial.

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Symptoms of a clinically significant illness that may, in the opinion of the
             investigator, influence the outcome of the trial in the 4 weeks before baseline visit
             and during the trial.

             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation
             (e.g., exposure to sunlight other than that associated with usual daily activities,
             use of tanning booth, etc.) within 2 weeks prior to the Day 1 visit or intention to
             have such exposure during the study, thought by the investigator likely to modify the
             subject's psoriasis.

          -  The effects of Ga-68-DOTA-TOC on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason and because PET imaging agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Ga-68-DOTA-TOC have the potential
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to administration of
             Ga-68-DOTA-TOC to mothers, breastfeeding mothers are also excluded from this study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, uncontrolled hematuria related to bladder injury or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that could limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab
             at these doses have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary
             to treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued.
             Negative serum pregnancy test will be required for women of childbearing potential.

          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive
             therapy.

          8. Antiviral therapy for HCV and HBV is allowed, but patient should not be on interferon.

          9. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with meclizine.

         10. Patient must not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to
             registration, cardiac arrhythmia, glaucoma, asthma or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

         11. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because meclizine is a Class B agent with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with meclizine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with meclizine.

             skin cancers. Patients are not considered to have a ""currently active"" malignancy if
             they have completed therapy and have been free of disease for ≥ 1 years.

          -  Patients with known and untreated or progressing brain metastases are excluded from
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events. Patients whose brain metastases have been treated with
             surgery and/or radiotherapy and are without evidence of progression on scan for at
             least 4 weeks, and are off steroids or antiseizure medications, will be eligible .

             medications with a narrow therapeutic window that are substrates of CYP2C19, CYP2C9,
             and/or CYP3A. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication is recommended. Caution
             should also be exercised for concomitant use of certain statin drugs (e.g.
             rosuvastatin and fluvastatin) due to potential increase in exposure from inhibition of
             BCRP and CYP2C9. An updated list of clinically relevant P450 drug interactions (e.g:
             Flockhart Table http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/) should be
             reviewed while screening patients for study.

               -  Patients taking warfarin should have international normalized ration (INR)
                  monitored regularly according to standard institutional practices

               -  Because rucaparib is a moderate inhibitor of P-gp in vitro, caution should be
                  exercised for patients receiving rucaparib and requiring concomitant medication
                  with digoxin. Patients taking digoxin should have their digoxin levels monitored
                  after starting rucaparib and then regularly per standard clinical practice.

          -  Patients on parenteral nutrition are not eligible. Patients must not have a
             pre-existing duodenal stent or any gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would, in

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, requirement for
             oxygen therapy, ongoing or active infection other than minor urinary tract infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Known history of chronic hepatitis B or C as evidenced by:

               -  Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen

               -  Positive test for qualitative hepatitis C viral load (by polymerase chain
                  reaction [PCR])

               -  Note: Subjects with positive hepatitis C antibody and negative quantitative
                  hepatitis C by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are eligible.

          -  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             rucaparib. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  Prior organ allograft or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

          -  Adverse effect of prior therapy not improved to Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 or below with the exception of alopecia or lymphopenia.

             treatment regimen may be permitted with prior advanced approval from the Lead
             Principal Investigator.

          -  Initiated denosumab or bisphosphonate therapy or adjusted denosumab or bisphosphonate
             dose/regimen within 4 weeks prior to first dose of rucaparib. Patients on a stable

             protein derivative (PPD) recently converted to positive.

          -  Use of non-oncology vaccines containing live virus for prevention of infectious
             diseases within 12 weeks prior to study drug. The use of inactivated seasonal
             influenza vaccines, e.g., Fluzone®, will be permitted on study without restriction.
