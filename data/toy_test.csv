             or Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Investigator opinion: Omalizumab treatment has provided significant clinical benefit
             despite experiencing 2 exacerbations in the past 12 months, and potential benefit from
             a switch to mepolizumab would not outweigh the potential harm after omalizumab
             withdrawal for the subject.

          8. No CVA within 6 months, no MI within 6 months

          9. The effects of mFOLFIRINOX on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because chemotherapy agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial
             are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman

             chronic diarrhea or inflammatory disease of the colon or rectum, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. mFOLFIRINOX is a regimen containing more
             than one chemotherapy agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with mFOLFIRINOX, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents. These potential risks may
             also apply to other agents used in this study.

          8. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with mFOLFIRINOX. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

             to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks) after the last dose of investigational drug
             Nivolumab. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24
             hours prior to the start of nivolumab. Women must not be breastfeeding. Men who are
             sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of
             less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP
             will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last
             dose of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e.,
             who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not
             require contraception. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any
             female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization
             (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is
             defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of
             other biological or physiological causes. WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed
             to adhere to contraception for a period of 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required
             for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational
             product. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be
             instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of
             investigational product. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of
             the half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that
             WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually active

             follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion or hysterectomy or documented
             bilateral oophorectomy. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea.
             In questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone
             and estradiol levels consistent with menopause must be tested. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their
             HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment.

        A female subject with reproductive potential is eligible to participate if she is not
        pregnant and agrees to follow one of the highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in
        females of reproductive potential from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication
        and until (at least five terminal half-lives or until any continuing pharmacologic effect
        has ended, whichever is longer) after the last dose of study medication and completion of
        the follow-up visit. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand
        how to properly use methods of contraception.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent prior to study participation.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  A current diagnosis of asthma (Subjects with a prior history of asthma are eligible if
             they have a current diagnosis of COPD, which is the primary cause of their respiratory
             symptoms).

          -  Subjects with known alpha-antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of COPD

          -  Subjects with active tuberculosis are excluded. Subjects with other respiratory

             asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver disease as per investigator
             assessment); stable chronic liver disease should generally be defined by the absence
             of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, oesophageal or gastric
             varices, or persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis; chronic stable hepatitis B and C (e.g.,
             presence of hepatitis B surface antigen or positive hepatitis C antibody test result

             otherwise meets entry criteria.

          -  Subjects with unstable or life threatening cardiac disease. The investigational
             product should be used with caution in subjects with severe cardiovascular disease. In
             the opinion of the investigator, use will only be considered if the benefit is likely
             to outweigh the risk in conditions such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina in
             the last 6 months, or unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring

             with the following abnormalities are excluded from participation in the study: atrial
             fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate >120 beats per minute (bpm), sustained or
             non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, second degree heart block Mobitz type II or
             third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted).

          -  Subjects with medical conditions such as narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention,
             prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder neck obstruction will be excluded unless, in the
             opinion of the study physician, the benefit outweighs the risk.

          -  Any subject who is considered unlikely to survive the duration of the study period or
             has any rapidly progressing disease or immediate life-threatening illness (e.g.,
             cancer). In addition, any subject who has any other condition (e.g., neurological
             condition) that is likely to affect respiratory function will not be included in the
             study.

          -  The effects of Ga-68-DOTA-TOC on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason and because PET imaging agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration

             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions to IV contrasts or reactions attributed to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to Ga-68-DOTA-TOC used in study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Ga-68-DOTA-TOC have the potential
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to administration of
             Ga-68-DOTA-TOC to mothers, breastfeeding mothers are also excluded from this study.
