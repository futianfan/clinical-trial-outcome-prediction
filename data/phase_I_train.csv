        Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a preventable and treatable disease characterised
        by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually
        progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to
        noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects
        the lungs, it also produces significant systemic consequences.

          -  The patient is clinically stable with no change in symptoms or medication, no
             admissions to hospital, and with neither antibiotic therapy nor systemic steroid use
             for at least 6 weeks prior to screening. (Screening may be rescheduled after an

          -  Has any clinically significant abnormality identified on the medical or laboratory
             evaluation, including 12-lead ECG. A subject with a clinically significant abnormality
             or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for this age group may be
             included only if the Investigator considers that the finding will not introduce
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Any
             questions regarding the significance of abnormal clinical findings in screening
             results should be discussed with the GSK Medical Monitor.

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma, including variants,
             or undifferentiated/poorly differentiated carcinoma of the head and neck (any site,
             except nasopharynx).

          2. Previously untreated stage IV disease (AJCC staging system, 6th edition), or,

          3. Patients with residual disease or regional recurrence of head and neck cancer after
             surgery and/or chemotherapy, but with no prior bortezomib, EGFR inhibitor therapy or
             head and neck radiotherapy. All such patients should be eligible to receive full dose
             radiation therapy, and must be evaluated and accepted for treatment by a Radiation
             Oncologist. Prior cisplatin is allowed if administered greater than 3 months earlier.

          4. Patients with no clinically measurable distant disease, or those with asymptomatic
             small distant lesions outside the radiation field of less than or equal to 3cm
             individual or aggregate diameter, but for whom palliation of local and regional
             disease is clinically warranted will be eligible.

          5. Any number of other prior systemic therapies is allowed. Patients must have fully
             recovered from the effects of any prior surgery, or chemotherapy. A minimum time
             period of 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) should elapse between the
             completion of prior chemotherapy and enrollment in the study.

          6. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of bortezomib in combination with cetuximab or
             cisplatin and radiation in patients <18 years of age, and head and neck cancer in
             children is exceedingly rare, except for those with disorders of DNA damage repair,
             bone marrow or transplant immunosuppression likely to have lower tolerance to these
             drugs and RT, children are excluded from this study.

          7. ECOG performance status 0-1 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 70 percent).

          8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL

               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits, except for patients with

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional upper limit of
                  normal

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits

             OR

             -creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with
             creatinine levels above institutional normal.

          9. The effects of bortezomib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must have agreed to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; prior vasectomy; tubal
             ligation or abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

         10. Adequate cognitive and neurologic function to protect against and detect and report
             toxicities experienced, and to understand and to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients with previously untreated nasopharyngeal cancer (any stage) will be excluded,
             but patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma will be eligible.

          2. Prior treatment with radiation to the head and neck, or systemic EGFR inhibitors or
             bortezomib is not allowed.

          3. Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          4. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          5. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          6. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to bortezomib, cetuximab, cisplatin or other agents used in study.

          7. Patients with greater than or equal to grade 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy because
             bortezomib can cause irreversible worsening and a painful type of chemotherapy
             associated peripheral neuropathy.

          8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          9. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bortezomib, cetuximab and
             cisplatin have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with bortezomib, cetuximab and cisplatin, breastfeeding should
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with bortezomib, cetuximab and cisplatin.
             These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

         10. HIV-positive patients or patients on any antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for possible pharmacodynamic interactions with bortezomib, cetuximab
             and cisplatin, particularly bone marrow and mucosal toxicity, which could affect the
             MTD. These patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.

                  metastases to be treated as part of this study must be 2.5cm or larger in maximal
                  diameter. The brain metastasis/es to be treated may not be more than 4cm in
                  maximal diameter, as assessed by CT or MRI scan. The brain metastasis may either
                  be un-resected or partially resected, provided that the target lesion (which may
                  include a resection cavity) remains between 2.5 and 4cm in diameter, as defined
                  in section 6. Whole brain radiation therapy may or may-not have been delivered
                  prior to entering this protocol.

          2. Unequivocal evidence of tumor recurrence or progression by MRI (or CT brain if a
             patient can not undergo MRI). Radiotherapy (with or without radiosensitizing drugs)
             must have been completed in the past. The earliest a patient can be enrolled in this
             study after radiotherapy is 14 days. The scan done prior to study entry documenting
             progression will be reviewed by the primary investigator to document tumor volume
             changes to provide a gross assessment of growth rate.

          3. Patients may have had: a) no prior chemotherapy, b) 1 prior adjuvant chemotherapy, c)
             1 prior adjuvant chemotherapy followed by 1 regimen for recurrent disease, or d) 1 or

             registration. Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive
             tumor will be eligible for assessment of response as long as there is residual
             enhancing evaluable disease that is documented by appropriate neuroimaging and
             patients have recovered from the effects of surgery. Patients who after surgery have
             no residual enhancing disease will still be eligible for enrollment, but only
             assessable for time to progression, and not for response.

          6. Patients must have a life expectancy > 8 weeks.

          7. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of > or = 60 (Karnofsky Performance
             Scale).

             weeks from vincristine, 6 weeks from nitrosoureas, and 3 weeks from procarbazine
             administration. Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of any other
             cytotoxic drugs which they may have received and must be 1 week from the completion of
             any non-cytotoxic drug therapy (e.g. 13-cis-retinoic acid, thalidomide, tamoxifen,
             etc.). For those patients previously treated with temozolomide, they may enroll and
             start the diet even 1 day after their last temozolomide dose.

          9. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (ANC> or = 1,500/mm3 and platelet
             count of > or = 100,000/mm3), adequate liver function (SGPT and alkaline phosphatase =
             or <2 times normal, bilirubin = or <1.5 mg%), and adequate renal function (BUN or
             creatinine = or <1.5 times institutional normal) prior to starting therapy.

         10. All acute toxic effects (excluding neurotoxicity or alopecia) of any prior therapy
             must have resolved to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade = or < 1.

         11. Patients who are eligible for the trial and who require resection of their tumor may
             begin the dietary restriction component of the therapy prior to their surgery
             providing the time to surgery is greater than 6 days. In these patients, tissue
             collected at surgery will be analysed for the effects of treatment. After surgery,
             patients will resume an ad lib diet for anywhere from 5-14 days prior to the
             re-initiation of the dietary methionine restriction at the same dose level and
             continuance with the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in-situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy
             for that disease for a minimum of 3 years.

          2. Patients have one or more of the following conditions may not participate in this
             study: a) active infection; b) pregnancy and/or disagree to practice adequate
             contraception; c) disease that will obscure toxicity or dangerously alter drug
             metabolism; d) serious intercurrent medical illness.

          -  The effects of oxaliplatin, capecitabine and sorafenib on the developing human fetus
             at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because DNA
             alkylating agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth
             control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Because the risk of toxicity in nursing infants secondary to oxaliplatin treatment of
             the mother is unknown but may be harmful, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No concomitant radiation therapy, or other systemic cancer therapies.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other toxicities.

          -  History of allergy to platinum compounds, capecitabine, sorafenib or to antiemetics
             appropriate for administration in conjunction with protocol-directed chemotherapy.

             or any other hemorrhage/bleeding event > CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 weeks of first dose of
             study drug, serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture, evidence or history of
             bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women are excluded from this study because oxaliplatin,
             capecitabine and sorafenib is a DNA alkylating agent with the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Female patients of reproductive potential must
             have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within two weeks prior to enrolling.

          -  Major surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of first
             study drug.

          -  Because of drug interactions with sorafenib, use of St. John's Wort or rifampin
             (rifampicin) is contraindicated. Patients may discontinue the use of these drugs to
             become eligible for the study

          -  Any condition that impairs patient's ability to swallow whole pills.

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) are excluded from the
             study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed, informed consent.

          -  Patients with AML, MDS (subtype RAEB-1 or RAEB-2), or MM whose disease has relapsed or
             is refractory to front line and/ or salvage therapy; elderly patients (≥ 60 years)
             with AML, MDS, MM who are not candidates for chemotherapy and for whom other therapy
             is inappropriate.

          -  Patients should have recovered from the acute adverse effects of prior therapies
             (excluding alopecia and grade II neuropathy).

          -  AML, MDS and MM are diseases of the haematopoietic system and can cause
             myelosuppression. Consequently supportive therapy should be given to ensure adequate
             values, according to local guidelines.

          -  A bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy performed within four weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function including the following:

               1. Patients with high blast counts can be included in the trial, if they can be
                  controlled by the use of hydroxyurea (500-3000 mg daily).

               2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper normal limit.

               3. AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x upper normal limit.

               4. Creatinine ≤1.5 x upper normal limit.

          -  Performance status (PS) ≤ 2 (ECOG scale).

          -  Estimated life-expectancy greater than 3 months.

          -  Female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to the start of the trial. A woman with reproductive potential is
             defined as one who is biologically capable of becoming pregnant. Patients who are not
             surgically sterile or postmenopausal must agree to use a medically acceptable and
             highly effective method of birth control for the duration of the study and to continue
             after the end of CHR-2797 treatment for a further 3 months (female patients) or for a
             further 6 months (for male patients and their partners). A highly effective method of
             birth control is defined as any method that results in a low failure rate, including
             implants, injectables, some intra-uterine devices (IUD's), sexual abstinence, and
             vasectomy/ sterilization. Sexually active males and females using oral contraceptive
             pills should also use barrier contraception. Although there is no reason to believe
             that the use of CHR-2797 has an effect on the pharmacokinetics of hormonal
             contraceptives, this has not yet been proven.

          -  Any co-existing medical condition that in the investigator's judgement will
             substantially increase the risk associated with the patient's participation in the
             study

          -  Psychiatric disorders or altered mental status precluding understanding of the
             informed consent process and/or completion of the necessary studies.

             evidence of demyelinating disease.

          -  Positive plasma / white cell JC virus (JCV) PCR (either compartment).

          -  The subject has a condition or situation that, in the investigator's judgment, is
             likely to cause the subject to be unable or unwilling to participate in study
             procedures or to complete all scheduled assessments.

          -  The subject has clinically significant abnormal laboratory values during the Screening
             period, other than those due to RA. Abnormal values are permitted if, upon re-test,
             the abnormality was resolved (ALT <2xULN, AST <2xULN).

             lenalidomide, and for four weeks after discontinuing this therapy. Sexually active
             males cannot participate unless they agree to use a condom (even if they have
             undergone a prior vasectomy) while having intercourse with a woman of child bearing
             potential while taking lenalidomide and for four weeks after stopping treatment. Women
             of child bearing potential (those who have not had a hysterectomy or the absence of
             menstrual periods for at least 24 consecutive months) must have a negative pregnancy

             symptomatic bone lesions (eg, uncontrolled pain or high risk of pathologic fracture)

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because

             tumor malignancy or lymphoma that is metastatic or unresectable for which standard
             curative measures do not exist, or are associated with minimal patient survival
             benefit.

          2. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.

          3. Patients must have completed any chemotherapy or biologic therapy greater than or
             equal to 4 weeks prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C,
             or UCN-01). Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any prior
             administration of study drug in a exploratory IND/Phase Zero study. Patients must be
             greater than or equal to 1 month since any prior radiation or major surgery. Patients
             must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity or adverse events.
             However, patients receiving bisphosphonates for any cancer or undergoing androgen
             deprivation therapy for prostate cancer are eligible for this therapy.

          4. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          5. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to
             2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%).

          6. Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          7. Patients must have normal or adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/microL.

               -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL.

               -  Total bilirubin within less than or equal to 1.5 normal institutional limits.

               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 x institutional upper limit of
                  normal.

               -  creatinine less than 1.5 x upper limit of normal

             OR

             -creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with
             creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal.

             We will allow patients with Gilbert s syndrome with total bilirubin up to 2.5 mg/dL.

          8. The effects of batracylin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 2 months after discontinuation from the
             study. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test in order
             to be eligible. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with batracylin, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with batracylin.

          9. Patients must have a slow acetylator NAT2 genotype defined as NAT2 5, NAT2 6, NAT2 7,
             or NAT2 14. Theoretically slow acetylators will have lower Ac-BAT concentrations. A
             number of different polymorphisms in the NAT2 give rise to amino acid substitutions,
             and these have been demonstrated to result in absence of catalytic activity in vitro
             (http://www.louisville.edu/medschool/pharmacology/NAT.html). Screening for the four
             variant alleles (NAT2 5, NAT2 6, NAT2 7 and NAT2 14) results in the detection of the
             vast majority of Caucasian slow acetylators, though additional alleles are also common
             in other ethnic groups. The precise percentage of slow acetylators also varies with
             ethnic origin, ranging from 90% in North Africans to less than 10% in many Asian
             populations, with a frequency of 50% in Caucasians. The incidence of fast acetylators
             (potentially with increased toxicity) is as follow: 50% among Caucasians, 50% among
             Africans, 90% among Japanese, and 20% among Egyptians. We plan to select the slow
             acetylators NAT2 subjects and determine the batracylin MTD in this population. The
             screening will occur prior to the study start and before patients sign the informed
             consent form. Cogenics will be performing the NAT2 analysis.

         10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

          2. Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial, with the
             exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for
             greater than or equal to 6 months after treatment of the brain metastases, without
             steroids or anti-seizure medications. These patients may be enrolled at the discretion
             of the principal investigator.

          3. Patients with clinically significant illnesses which could compromise participation in
             the study, including, but not limited to, active or uncontrolled infection, immune
             deficiencies or confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C,
             uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months,

          1. Patients receiving other therapy (either intrathecal or systemic) designed
             specifically to treat their leptomeningeal disease are not eligible for this study.
             However, patients receiving concomitant non-cytotoxic therapy (hormonal or cytostatic
             therapy) to control systemic disease or bulk CNS disease will be eligible, provided
             the therapy is not a phase I agent, an agent which significantly penetrates the CSF or
             an agent known to have serious unpredictable CNS side effects.

          2. (1. continued) No other cytotoxic chemotherapies are allowed (non-cytotoxic therapies
             such as herceptin, tarceva, arimidex etc are allowed at the investigator's

             obstruction will be determined by routine nuclear medicine CSF flow study parameters.
             If patients have evidence of block that is subsequently proven to be relieved after
             focal XRT, these patients can enroll immediately after repeat flow study shows block
             to be relieved.

          4. Patients with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt must have an
             on/off device in their shunt systems to be eligible for the study. Patients must be
             able to tolerate shunt closure for >/= 4 hours without development of clinical signs
             of increased intracranial pressure. Patients unable to tolerate shunt closure for >/=
             4 hours will not be eligible for the study.

          5. Women of childbearing potential (females who are not surgically sterile or who have
             had a period in the last 12 months) must have a negative serum pregnancy test and must

             treatment after 7 days) are not eligible for this study, except those with HIV and
             AIDS-related lymphomatous meningitis).

          7. Use of any other investigational drug within 7 days prior to study entry. This period
             should be extended if the patient has received any investigational agent that is known
             to have delayed toxicities after 7 days or a prolonged half-life.

          8. Patients not able to undergo magnetic resonance testing. i.e. pacemaker.

          9. Patients may not have had prior treatment with Temozolomide.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All patients must have a diagnosis of metastatic infiltrating carcinoma of the breast
        including hormone receptor testing. At least one site of metastatic disease must have been
        confirmed by pathologic or cytologic material. In the choice of a biopsy site, the PI will
        weigh the morbidity the diagnostic procedure against the probability of positive yield of
        the diagnostic procedure.

        All pathologic material must be reviewed by the Pathology Laboratory of the National Cancer
        Institute (NCI) before treatment.

        The tumor MUST stain positive for CEA, by standard immuno-histochemistry performed at the
        Pathology Laboratory of the NCI.

        --Method: 5 microM formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections are deparaffinized and blocked
        with methanol-30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). After antigen retrieval by boiling in citrate
        buffer, or heating in a microwave oven for 10 minutes, slides are incubated with monoclonal
        antibodies anti-CEA (diluted 1/1000 Dako). Then, slides are immunostained with
        avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex and developed with diaminobenzidine. Harris' hematoxylin
        was used to counter stain the slides. Positivity is defined as greater than 30% of cells
        staining.
