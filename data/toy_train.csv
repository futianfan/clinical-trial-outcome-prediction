                  A) Untreated FSGS

                  B) Steroid-dependent FSGS

                  C) Steroid resistant FSGS

                  D) Recurrent FSGS, with functioning allograft

                  E) FSGS in ESRD, receiving hemodialysis

               2. Adults greater than or equal to18 will be eligible for all studies.

               3. Children greater than 20 kilograms, will be eligible for all branches of the
                  study except for treatment of steroid resistant FSGS with pirfenidone, as
                  pirfenidone has not previously been administered to pediatric patients in any
                  setting. Children less than 20 kilograms will be excluded from the study for the
                  following reason: plasma exchange in patients less than 20 kilograms requires a
                  red blood cell transfusion, which significantly increases the risk of the
                  procedure by exposing the patient to the risk of transfusion associated
                  infections, and the safety of an aggressive course of plasma exchange has not
                  been established in this population.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Secondary FSGS: HIV-associated FSGS or hyperfiltration FSGS, including FSGS associated
             with congenital renal abnormalities, renal mass reduction, reflux nephropathy,
             interstitial nephritis, and sickle cell anemia are excluded.

          2. Patients with disease associated with immunosuppression, other than chronic renal
             failure.

          3. The presence of malignancy or the history of other serious, complicating illness such
             as myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident in the past six months, at the
             discretion of the investigators.

          4. For plasma exchange: A Department of Transfusion Medicine consultant will evaluate all
             potential plasma exchange patients. Those with prolonged PT, PTT, platelet count less
             than 100,000 or receiving anticoagulant therapy will undergo plasma exchange only if
             the consultant considers this to be safe.

          5. For prednisone: uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (requiring greater than 100 units of
             insulin/day with the concurrence of the Endocrinology consultant), active infection
             including hepatitis B or C (if that is the advice of the Hepatology consultant),
             infection with HIV (as these patients are at increased risk of avascular necrosis),
             other active infection (if that is the advice of the Infectious Disease consultant),
             history of avascular necrosis or bone densitometry indicating bone mass less than 2SD
             below normal, active ulcer disease, history of steroid-induced psychosis, morbid
             obesity, positive PPD or history of past positive PPD without adequate treatment are
             excluded.

          6. For Cyclophosphamide:

        A) Allergy or hypersensitivity to cyclophosphamide

        B) Leukocyte less than 3000 cells/microliter or ANC less than 1500 cells/microliter or
        evidence of bone marrow compromise

        C) Prior irradiation to the heart or therapy with doxorubicin or other cardiotoxic
        medication (may increase the risk for cardiotoxicity)

        D) Peritoneal dialysis, as there is no published evidence that cyclophosphamide metabolites
        can be safely removed.

        E) Certain drugs will be used with caution or avoided. Barbiturates and phenytoin induce
        the hepatic enzymes that metabolize cyclophosphamide and therefore if these medications are
        required, cyclophosphamide doses may need to be increased to achieve a comparable
        immunosuppressive effect. Drugs that inhibit cyclophosphamide metabolism include
        allopurinol, imipramine, and phenothiazines, chloramphenicol and chlorpromazine; these
        drugs will be avoided. NSAID increase the risk of hyponatremia; these drugs will be
        avoided.

             HIV assay (PCR or bDNA)

          -  Cardiac condition that cannot be controlled by medication: Because of the risk of
             anemia associated with RBV use and the potential to induce cardiac ischemia, subjects
             with a positive cardiac stress test are ineligible. Therefore, subjects > 40 years of
             age with ≥ 1 risk factor for ASHD (i.e., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking
             history, family history) should have an EKG preformed. If the EKG is abnormal and

          -  Consent: A signed and dated written informed consent must be obtained from the subject
             or subject's legally acceptable representative prior to study participation. An
             informed consent must be signed prior to any change in the subject's medication
             regimen, including withholding medications prior to Visit 1.

          -  Gender: Male or female. Females are eligible to participate only if they are currently
             not pregnant and not lactating. Females of child-bearing potential will be required to
             use a highly effective method for avoiding pregnancy (i.e., contraception with a

             a urine pregnancy test at Visits 1, 2, 3, and 4. Any female who becomes pregnant
             during the study will be withdrawn. Female subjects should not be enrolled if they
             plan to become pregnant during the time of study participation.

          -  Age: 15 years and older.

          -  Asthma Diagnosis: A diagnosis of persistent asthma, for at least three months, as
             defined by the following American Thoracic Society definition:

        Asthma is a clinical syndrome characterized by increased responsiveness of the
        tracheobronchial tree to a variety of stimuli. The major symptoms of asthma are paroxysms
        of dyspnea, wheezing, and cough, which may vary from mild and almost undetectable to severe
        and unremitting (status asthmaticus). The primary physiological manifestation of this
        hyperresponsiveness is variable airway obstruction. This can take the form of spontaneous
        fluctuations in the severity of obstruction, substantial improvements in the severity of
        obstruction following bronchodilators or corticosteroids, or increased obstruction caused
        by drugs or other stimuli [American Thoracic Society, 1987a].

        NOTE: Intermittent and seasonal asthma, as well as exercise-induced bronchospasm alone, are
        excluded.

          -  Asthma Therapy: 3 months' prior and current use of one of the following asthma
             therapies, with no change in regimen during the month prior to Visit 1:

               -  Scheduled or as-needed inhaled or oral short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA).
                  Subjects must be able to replace their current short-acting beta2-agonist with
                  albuterol/salbutamol, to be used only on an as-needed basis for the duration of
                  the study.

               -  Allowed non-corticosteroid controller therapy (e.g., anticholinergics and
                  cromolyn).

               -  One of the following inhaled corticosteroids taken at the corresponding daily
                  dose:

        criteria.

        Inhaled Corticosteroid (Total Daily Dose) Beclomethasone dipropionate (≤420mcg)
        Beclomethasone dipropionate HFA (≤240mcg) Budesonide (≤400mcg) Flunisolide (≤1000mcg)
        Fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol (≤220mcg) Fluticasone propionate inhalation
        powder (≤250mcg) Mometasone furoate (≤220mcg) Triamcinolone acetonide (≤1000mcg) Subjects
        taking ADVAIR 100/50mcg BID are eligible to replace ADVAIR with FLOVENT HFA 110mcg BID for
        14 days prior to Visit 1. This change will be at the Investigator's clinical discretion,
        taking each individual's current and past asthma stability into account. The subject must
        be aware of the risks and benefits of switching their medication and acknowledge this by
        signing an informed consent prior to any change in the subject's medication regimen.

          -  Asthma Severity: An FEV1 between 65% - 95% of predicted value at Visit 1 after
             withholding asthma medications as detailed in the protocol.

        At Visit 2, subjects must also be experiencing minimum asthma symptoms as defined in
        Section 5.2.3, ""Randomization Criteria"", and in Section 6.2 of the protocol.

        Predicted FEV1 will be based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
        (NHANES III) predicted normal values [Hankinson, 1999].

          -  Rhinitis Diagnosis: A diagnosis of seasonal allergic rhinitis defined as follows:

               -  A clinical history (written or verbal confirmation) of allergic rhinitis with the
                  seasonal onset and offset of nasal allergy symptoms during each of the previous 2
                  relevant allergy seasons (captured in source documents only).

        AND •A positive skin test reaction to a geographically relevant seasonal allergen, as
        determined by the skin prick method, within 24 months prior to or at Visit 1.

        For the purposes of this study, a positive skin test reaction is defined as a wheal
        diameter that is at least 3mm greater than diluent control using 1:20 W:V glycerinated

                       definition:

             Asthma is a clinical syndrome characterized by increased responsiveness of the airways
             to a variety of stimuli. The major symptoms of asthma are episodes of dyspnea,
             wheezing, and cough, which may vary from mild and almost undetectable to severe and
             unremitting (status asthmaticus). The primary physiological manifestation of this
             hyperresponsiveness is variable airway obstruction. This can take the form of
             spontaneous fluctuations in the severity of obstruction, substantial improvements in
             the severity of obstruction following bronchodilators or corticosteroids, or increased
             obstruction caused by drugs or other stimuli [American Thoracic Society, 1987].

               1. Asthma Medication History: A subject must be using a low to medium dose of an ICS
                  (Table 1) OR a combination of controller medications (Table 2), containing a low
                  (total daily) dose ICS (as defined in Table 1) for at least 4 weeks preceding
                  screening.

             Table 1 (ICS Dosage Table) Inhaled Corticosteroid (Dosage (mcg/day))(LowMedium)

                       emphysema) in accordance with the following definition by the American
                       Thoracic Society:

        COPD is a preventable and treatable disease state characterised by airflow limitation that
        is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is associated
        with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases,
        primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also produces
        significant systemic consequences [Celli, 2004].

          -  A post-albuterol FEV1/FVC ratio of ≤ 0.70

          -  A post-albuterol FEV1 ≥ 0.70L and ≤ 70% of predicted normal OR a post-albuterol FEV1
             of ≤ 0.70L and ≥40% of predicted normal but still ≤70% of predicted normal based on
             NHANES III reference values [Hankinson, 1999].

          -  Current or previous smokers with a cigarette smoking history of ≥ 10 pack-years.
             [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked
             (e.g., 10 pack-years is equal to 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes
             per day for 20 years]. Former-smokers are defined as subjects who have discontinued
             smoking for ≥ 6 months prior to Visit 1. Subjects who decide to stop smoking at Visit
             1 will not be eligible for participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not be enrolled in the study:

             neuromuscular, hepatic, gastric, or hematological abnormalities, or peripheral
             vascular disease. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through study participation
             or would affect the efficacy analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the
             study.

          -  A respiratory diagnosis other than COPD (e.g., lung cancer, bronchiectasis,
             sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, lung fibrosis), including subjects with a diagnosis of

          -  An abnormal and clinically significant chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan
             not believed to be due to the presence of COPD. A chest x-ray must be taken if the
             subject has not had one within 6 months of Visit 1.

          -  An abnormal and clinically significant 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). For the
             purposes of this study, an abnormal ECG is defined as a 12-lead tracing which is
             interpreted with (but not limited to) any of the following:

               -  Myocardial ischemia

               -  Clinically significant conduction abnormalities (e.g., left bundle branch block,

                  tachycardia) The study investigator will determine the clinical significance of
                  any ECG abnormality and determine if a subject is precluded from entering the
                  study.

          -  Previously diagnosed cancer unless it is in complete clinical remission (no evidence
             of any tumor burden) at Visit 1. Localized carcinomas of the skin that have been

             pectoris, unstable hypertension, seizure disorder, or psychiatric illness which in the
             Investigators opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial
             or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol.

          3. Untreated brain metastases (or local treatment of brain metastases within the last 6
             months) due to the poor prognosis of these patients and difficulty ascertaining the

          6. The presence of a second malignancy within the last 2 years, other than squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer because it will complicate the
             primary objective of the study. Cancer survivors who have been free of disease for at

         13. Corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation with other medications. If the medication can
             be discontinued and an alternative medication started that does not cause QTc
             prolongation, the patient would be eligible. If no alternative medication is available
             and the medication cannot be discontinued for medical reasons, then the patient would
             not be eligible.

             greater than or equal to 480 msec on screening ECG, the screen ECG may be repeated
             twice (at least 24 hours apart). The average QTc from the three screening ECGs must be
             less than 480 msec in order for the patient to be eligible for the study). Patients

             function.

         21. Major surgery within 4-weeks, or incompletely healed surgical incision before starting
             study medications. Biopsies, port placements, and dental work are examples of

             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cediranib and olaparib are agents
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment
             of the mother with cediranib and olaparib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with cediranib or olaparib; these potential risks may also apply to
             other agents used in this study

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with cediranib or olaparib; in

          3. Be over 8 years old and less than 50 years. The first four patients will be adults
             (age 18-50 years)

          4. Be able and willing to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy: Females who are pregnant or lactating will be excluded from the study as
             the influence of pregnancy on the markers is not known nor is the safety of taurine
             supplementation in pregnancy.

          2. Continued antioxidant intake:

               1. Individuals currently taking taurine, over the counter energy drinks containing
                  taurine or other high dose antioxidants and unwilling to discontinue this for the
                  study period (including a 2 week wash out period) will be excluded as such intake
                  will likely impact laboratory results.

               2. Individuals taking Vitamin C as a prescribed treatment for their homocystinuria
                  will be excluded as the antioxidant therapy may impact antioxidant and
                  inflammation markers. (As Vitamin C is not standard of care for this disease we
                  anticipate this to have minimal impact on recruitment.)

               3. Individuals currently taking platelet aggregation inhibitors such as salicylate
                  on a self prescribed basis and unwilling to discontinue this for the study period
                  (including a washout period of at least two weeks prior to the study) will be
                  excluded as salicylate intake will impact platelet study results. Individuals
                  taking salicylate (or other platelet aggregation inhibitors) prescribed as a
                  therapy for their homocystinuria or other health issues will not be asked to stop
                  the medication. They will participate in the study, but will be excluded only
                  from the platelet studies.

          3. Medication interactions: Individuals unable or unwilling to abstain from use of cyclic
             guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (such as Viagra) during
             the study period will be excluded from the nitroglycerin-induced flow-mediated
             dilatation studies in accordance with known labeling contraindications.

          4. Inflammatory status:

               1. Individuals who have a significant chronic illness that has a marked inflammatory
                  component will be excluded from the study as the illness will impact inflammatory
                  markers.

               2. Patients with an acute illness, which may impact inflammatory biomarkers, will be
                  postponed for study entry until the acute illness is resolved. Entry into the
                  study at a later day will be offered.

          5. Recent cardiovascular event. Cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarct, deep
             vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, thrombosis, or uncontrolled hypertension) may
             interfere with platelet function studies and with various mediators during the first
             months after the event. Patients who had such an event within the last 6 months will
             be excluded.

          6. Hypertriglyceridemia. Individuals with a triglyceride level above 300 mg/dl will be
             excluded from the study.

          7. Informed consent: Individuals who are unwilling or unable to consent, or in the case
             of minors who are unwilling or unable to assent will be excluded due to lack of
             ability to ensure informed consent.

          8. Study compliance and integrity: Individual who anticipate an inability to comply with

             women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing
             potential; (Note: A woman of childbearing potential is one who is biologically capable
             of becoming pregnant; this includes women who are using contraceptives or whose sexual
             partners are either sterile or using contraceptives)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document;
             as the correlative studies are critical to the clinical and scientific value of the
             trial, CD4 count/HIV viral load determinations will be required, and participation in
             the tumor-based correlative studies will be strongly recommended; additionally,
             investigators MUST request sample donation to the AIDS Cancer Specimen Resource
             (ACSR); however, the patient may refuse sample donation; patients accrued to the
             expansion phase of the study will be required to undergo pharmacokinetic sampling

          -  Subjects must in the opinion of the Investigator be capable of complying with this
             protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events (toxicities not improved to =< Grade 1) due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier; additionally, patients experiencing disease
             progression within 3 months of platinum-based therapy will be excluded from trial
             participation

          -  Due to availability of effective first- and second-line therapies (as well as
             disease-specific clinical trials), patients with diagnosis of active Kaposi sarcoma
             will be excluded from study participation; however, persons with other active
             malignancy with prior history of Kaposi sarcoma can be considered for participation at
             the discretion of the Study Chair

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to the study agents used in study (including hypersensitivity to
             paclitaxel, Cremophor, or platins)

          -  For subjects assigned to take vorinostat, inability to take oral medications;
             vorinostat capsules must be administered whole; note: this criterion does NOT apply to
             subjects treated on the Expansion Cohort (accruals post February 1, 2013)

          -  As ketoconazole may inhibit paclitaxel metabolism, patients receiving ketoconazole for
             any treatment indication are ineligible; patients receiving any other medications or
             substances that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 enzymes will be eligible;
             however, use all such medications or substances must be documented in the Case Report
             Forms

          -  For subjects assigned to take vorinostat, prior exposure to vorinostat or other known
             histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors for cancer therapy; patients should not have
             taken valproic acid, another histone deacetylase inhibitor, for at least 2 weeks prior
             to study enrollment; note: this criterion does NOT apply to subjects treated on the
             Expansion Cohort (accruals post February 1, 2013)

          -  Since zidovudine and stavudine have potential for severe hematological toxicity
             potentially overlapping with toxicities of the study therapy, treatment with these
             agents will be disallowed

          -  Due to potential toxicity associated with study therapy (particularly with
             paclitaxel), patients with peripheral neuropathy > Grade 1 will be excluded from study
             participation

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, opportunistic infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements; patients with HIV infection will be
             eligible provided they meet the criteria specified; patients with known Hepatitis B
             infection should be screened for active disease prior to study participation; patients
             with chronic Hepatitis C infection will be eligible at the discretion of the treating
             investigator

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study and women who become pregnant while on
             study must be immediately discontinued; women who are breastfeeding will not be
             eligible for study participation

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be included in the study based on the following criteria.

          -  Patients must have histologically proven glioblastoma, gliosarcoma or anaplastic
             glioma to be eligible for the Phase I component of this protocol. Anaplastic gliomas
             include anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic
             mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMO), or malignant glioma NOS (not otherwise specified).
             Patients will be eligible if the original histology was low-grade glioma and a
             subsequent histological diagnosis of a malignant glioma is made. Only patients with
             histologically proven or imaging proven recurrent glioblastoma or gliosarcoma will be
             eligible for the Phase II component. Wafer acceptable if recurrence is confirmed.

          -  All patients must sign an informed consent indicating their awareness of the
             investigational nature of this study. Patients must have signed an authorization for
             the release of their protected health information.

          -  Patients must be 18 years old or older.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) equal or greater than 60

          -  At the time of registration:

               -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy to < grade 2
                  toxicity per CTC version 4 (except deep vein thrombosis )

                    1. 28 days from any investigational agent,

                    2. 4 weeks (28 days) from prior cytotoxic therapy,

                    3. 2 weeks (14 days) from vincristine,

                    4. 6 weeks (42 days) from nitrosoureas,

                    5. 3 weeks (21 days) from procarbazine administration,

                    6. greater than or equal to1 week (7 days) for non-cytotoxic agents, e.g.,
                       interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer
                       does not count).

          -  Patients who receive anticancer agents for non-therapeutic purposes unrelated to this
             study (such as presurgically for obtaining pharmacology data for the agent) will be
             eligible to enter the study provided they have recovered from the toxic effects of the
             agent if any. Any questions related to the definition of noncytotoxic agents should be
             directed to the Study Chair.

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (ANC greater than or equal to
             1,500/mm3, platelet count of greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3), adequate liver
             function (SGPT less than or equal to 3 times upper limit normal and alkaline
             phosphatase less than or equal to 2 times upper limit normal, total bilirubin less
             than or equal to 1.5mg/dl, Patients with high bilirubin levels related to known
             diagnosis of benign hyperbilirubinemia (Gilbert s syndrome) will be eligible ., and
             adequate renal function (BUN less than or equal to 1.5 times institutional normal and
             Creatinine < 1.5 mg/dl) prior to registration. These tests must be performed within 14
             days prior to registration.

          -  Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression as determined by
             an MRI scan done prior to study entry which will be reviewed by the treating physician
             to confirm and document recurrence.

        Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic
        radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation
        necrosis using the local institutional standards for such determination including advanced
        imaging or surgery.

          -  The baseline on-study MRI scan should be performed within 14 days (+ 3 working days)
             prior to registration but before starting treatment and on a steroid dose that has
             been stable or decreasing for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased
             between the date of imaging and registration (or at that time), a new baseline MRI is
             required. The same type of scan, i.e., MRI must be used throughout the period of
             protocol treatment for tumor measurement.

          -  Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be
             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:

               1. At least 4 weeks (28 days ) have elapsed from the date of surgery and the
                  patients have recovered from the effects of surgery.

               2. Evaluable or measureable disease following resection of recurrent Malignant
                  Glioma is not mandated for eligibility into the study.

               3. To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, a MRI should be
                  done no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or at least 4
                  weeks post-operatively, within 14 days prior to registration. If the 96-hour scan
                  is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated. If the
                  steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration, a new
                  baseline MRI is required on a stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.

          -  Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of greater
             than or equal to 12 weeks (84 days) from the completion of radiation therapy to study
             entry except if there is unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence (such as
             histological confirmation or advanced imaging data such as PET scan) in which case at
             least 4 weeks (28 days) from completion of radiation therapy will suffice.

          -  Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic
             radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation
             necrosis based upon either PET or Thallium scanning, MR spectroscopy or
             surgical/pathological documentation of disease.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative B-HCG pregnancy test documented
             within 14 days prior to registration. Women of childbearing potential must not be
             pregnant, must not be breast-feeding, and must practice adequate contraception for the
             duration of the study, and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication.
             Patients must not be pregnant because animal studies show that bevacizumab and
             Vorinostat are teratogenic.

          -  Male patients on treatment with Vorinostat must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception for the duration of the study, and for 30 days after the last dose of
             study medication.

          -  Patient must be able to tolerate the procedures required in this study including
             periodic blood sampling, study related assessments, and management at the treating
             institution for the duration of the study.

          -  Patients receiving treatment with any antiepileptic medications except Valproic acid
             (because of its HDAC inhibitory activity) can be included in the study. Vorinostat is
             not metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4); however, Vorinostat may potentially
             suppress CYP 3A4 activity. Therefore, patients should preferably be treated with
             nonenzyme inducing anti-epileptic medications although this is not mandatory. If
             enzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs are used, monitoring of these drug levels should
             be considered, as considered clinically appropriate by the treating physician.

          -  For the Phase II portion of the study, patients may have had treatment for no more
             than 2 prior relapses. There is no limit to the number of relapses for the phase I
             portion of the study provided the functional status and other eligibility criteria for
             enrollment are met. Relapse is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e.
             radiation+/- chemo if that was used as initial therapy). The intent therefore is that
             patients had no more than 3 prior therapies (initial and treatment for 2 relapses). If
             the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed disease and no anti-cancer therapy
             was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient undergoes another surgical
             resection, this is considered as 1 relapse. For patients who had prior therapy for a
             low-grade glioma, the surgical diagnosis of a high-grade glioma will be considered the
             first relapse

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of belinostat in patients < 18 years of age, children
             are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric Phase I
             single-agent trials.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2
             (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60 percent.

        serum creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance greater than or
        equal to 60 mL/min for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal, as
        determined by a measured 24-hour creatinine clearance Baseline evaluations should be
        conducted within 7 days of treatment start date.

          -  Patients with abnormal liver function will be eligible. Patients with active hemolysis
             should be excluded. No distinction will be made between liver dysfunction due to
             metastases and liver dysfunction due to other causes.

          -  Patients with biliary obstruction for which a stent has been placed are eligible,
             provided the stent has been in place for at least 10 days prior to the first dose of
             belinostat and the liver function has stabilized. Two measurements at least 2 days
             apart that put the patient in the same hepatic dysfunction stratum will be accepted as
             evidence of stable hepatic function. There should be no evidence of biliary sepsis.

          -  Patients with gliomas or brain metastases who require corticosteroids or
             anticonvulsants must be on a stable dose of corticosteroids and seizure free for 1
             month prior to enrollment. Patients with known brain metastases should have had brain
             irradiation (whole brain or gamma knife) more than 4 weeks before starting the
             protocol. Note that patients should have had their steroids tapered to low dose (i.e.,
             < 1.5 mg of dexamethasone/day).

          -  The effects of belinostat on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Prior therapy with belinostat.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to belinostat, including hydroxamate compounds or
             arginine.

          -  Patients should not have taken valproic acid, another HDAC inhibitor, for at least 2
             weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing
             or active infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because belinostat is an HDAC inhibitor
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with belinostat, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with belinostat.

          -  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive patients who are not on retroviral therapy
             will not be excluded from cohort 1, the normal liver function cohort. HIV positive
             patients who are not on retroviral therapy will be excluded from cohorts 2-4 because
             of confounding effects from potential complications from HIV and opportunistic
             infections.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for the increased risk of liver dysfunction from the antiretroviral
             therapies themselves and because of potential pharmacokinetics (PK) interactions with
             belinostat. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in these groups of patients when
             indicated.

          -  Patients with significant cardiovascular disease (New York Heart Association Class III
             or IV cardiac disease), symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction
             within the past 6 months, unstable angina, unstable arrhythmia or a need for
             anti-arrhythmic therapy (use of frequency adjusting medication for atrial fibrillation
             is allowed, if stable medication for at least last month prior to initiation of
             belinostat treatment and medication not listed as causing Torsades de Points), or
             evidence of acute ischemia on electrocardiogram (ECG). Marked baseline prolongation of
             Q wave, T wave (QT)/Corrected QT Interval (QTc) interval, e.g., repeated demonstration

             contraception during the treatment period and for at least 3 months thereafter. Female
             subjects should avoid the use of estrogen-containing contraceptives, since romidepsin
             may reduce the effectiveness of estrogen-containing contraceptives. An in vitro
             binding assay determined that romidepsin competes with β-estradiol for binding to
             estrogen receptors.

          7. Pathologic diagnosis and other conditions relating to the different arms of the study:

               -  Arm A Recurrent glioma: Pathological diagnosis of glioma (grade 2-4) is required.
                  All patients are required to have initially undergone fractionated radiation
                  therapy, to between 55 Gy to 70 Gy in fractions of 1.8-2 Gy as part of 'first
                  line therapy'. The diagnosis of 'recurrence' is to be made by the treating
                  physician on the basis of radiological and clinical data. Measurable disease is
                  not required.

               -  Arm A High-grade meningioma: Pathological diagnosis of high-grade meningioma, as
                  defined by WHO grade 2 or 3 (also known as atypical and anaplastic/malignant
                  meningioma). WHO grade 1 meningiomas with an elevated Ki67 proliferation rate of
                  > or = 8% are also considered high-grade for the purposes of this trial, due to
                  their poor prognosis32, 86-88. The meningioma may be treated in the scenario of
                  either adjuvant treatment (radiation therapy following complete / sub-total /
                  biopsy only resection) or recurrent disease (re-growth following surgery alone).
                  Measurable disease is not required.

               -  Arm B Large brain metastases: Pathological diagnosis of malignancy is required,
                  from either the primary tumor or a metastasis. A radiological diagnosis (CT or
                  MRI scan) of one of more brain metastases is required. At least one of the brain
                  metastases to be treated as part of this study must be 2.5cm or larger in maximal
                  diameter. The brain metastasis/es to be treated may not be more than 4cm in
                  maximal diameter, as assessed by CT or MRI scan. The brain metastasis may either
                  be un-resected or partially resected, provided that the target lesion (which may
                  include a resection cavity) remains between 2.5 and 4cm in diameter, as defined
                  in section 6. Whole brain radiation therapy may or may-not have been delivered
                  prior to entering this protocol.

                  other protocols conducted by Dr. Hassan in the National Cancer Institute (NCI),
                  epithelial mesotheliomas and pancreatic cancers do not need to be assessed for
                  mesothelin expression since all of these tumors have been shown to express
                  mesothelin. Other metastatic or unresectable cancers must be shown to expresses
                  mesothelin as assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
                  (RT-PCR) or immunohistochemistry on tumor tissue. Bi-phasic mesotheliomas must

               8. Serology:

                    1. Seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. (The
                       experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact
                       immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can have decreased immune
                       competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental treatment and
                       more susceptible to its toxicities.)

                    2. Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C
                       antibody. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be
                       tested for the presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be Hepatitis C virus
                       ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) negative.

               9. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of
                  the potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

                       Gilbert's Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl.

              12. More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the
                  time the patient receives the preparative regimen, and patient's toxicities must
                  have recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as alopecia or
                  vitiligo).

                  Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3
                  weeks, as long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less.

              13. Subject's must be co-enrolled in protocol 03-C-0277.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients with sarcomatoid mesothelioma as mesothelin is not expressed in this type of
             mesothelioma.
